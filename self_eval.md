# Self-Evaluation

1. Reflect on your learning and work today. What are you most proud of?
> I am proud of creating methods that actually worked! It was kind of fun to feel like I was stuck, confused, frustrated as to why my check_stock method wasn't working only to find out it was all because I capitalized the I in the if conditional, haha.

2. What is the power of using methods in our applications?
> Some benefits I can think of are it helps with readability, as well as code reuse and organization. They can be called multiple times within a program without having to duplicate to code in multipled places.
